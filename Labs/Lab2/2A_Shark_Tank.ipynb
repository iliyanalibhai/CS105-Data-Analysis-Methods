        "\n",
        "_Shark Tank_ is a reality TV show. Contestants present their idea for a company to a panel of investors (a.k.a. \"sharks\"), who then decide whether or not to invest in that company.  The investors give a certain amount of money in exchange for a percentage stake in the company (\"equity\"). If you are not familiar with the show, you may want to watch part of an episode [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VBmLGUDxWA) to get a sense of how it works.  You can also search for a clip on YouTube.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data that you will examine in this lab contains data about all contestants from the first 6 seasons of the show, including:\n",
        "- the name and industry of the proposed company\n",
        "- whether or not it was funded (i.e., the \"Deal\" column)\n",
        "- which sharks chose to invest in the venture (N.B. There are 7 regular sharks, not including \"Guest\". Each shark has a column in the data set, labeled by their last name.)\n",
        "- if funded, the amount of money the sharks put in and the percentage equity they got in return\n",
        "\n",
        "To earn full credit on this lab, you should:\n",
        "- use built-in `pandas` methods (like `.sum()` and `.max()`) instead of writing a for loop over a `DataFrame` or `Series`\n",
        "- use the split-apply-combine pattern wherever possible\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, if you can't think of a vectorized solution, a `for` loop is still better than no solution at all!"
